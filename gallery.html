It's commendable that beyond the usual politics of caste and religion, we are focusing deeply on development. However, achieving this rapid pace of growth won't be easy. If India continues at its current 7% growth rate, it will likely reach around $16 trillion by 2047 - not the $30 trillion target we aspire for. Therefore, we need to generate an additional $14 trillion in GDP growth by innovating and creating novel products, intellectual property, and businesses.</p>

            Antitrust Body Finds Apple Abused Position In Apps Market In India
            The report comes as Apple faces increased antitrust scrutiny in other regions (Representational)
            
            
            New Delhi: An investigation by the country's antitrust body has found that Apple exploited its dominant position in the market for app stores on its iOS operating system, engaging "in abusive conduct and practices", a confidential report seen by Reuters showed.
            The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been investigating Apple since 2021 for possibly abusing its dominant position in the app market by forcing developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system.
            
            Apple has denied wrongdoing saying it was a small player in India where phones that use Google's Android system are dominant.</p>

"It appears that no one - including the contractor, Delhi government and DDA - apprised the Lt Governor (L-G) that permission of Supreme Court needs to be obtained before cutting the trees," it said.
            "We have perused the two affidavits filed by the vice-chairman of DDA and also the perused affidavit filed by the secretary, forest department. There was reluctance to remember what exactly transpired during L-G's visit. Now the truth has come out. Mr Ashok Kumar Gupta's affidavit explicitly stated what exactly transpired," the court said.
            
            On June 26, the Supreme Court ordered DDA officer Ashok Kumar Gupta to file "a detailed affidavit" as to what exactly transpired during the visit of the L-G to the Ridge area where 1,100 trees were cut. "He will also state if any directions were orally issued by the L-G," the court had said.</p>
